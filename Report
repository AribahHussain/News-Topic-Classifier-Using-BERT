📰 Project Title: News Topic Classifier Using BERT
📌 Overview
This project uses a fine-tuned BERT model to classify news articles into specific categories such as World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The model processes raw text input and predicts the most appropriate news topic with high accuracy, leveraging the power of transformer-based deep learning.

🎯 Objective
To automatically classify news headlines or articles into relevant categories using NLP techniques and a pre-trained BERT model, improving speed and consistency in news tagging.

⚙️ Key Features
Fine-tuned BERT for multi-class classification.

Supports topics: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech.

Tokenization and encoding via Hugging Face Tokenizer.

Softmax probability output with predicted class.

Lightweight Gradio UI (optional) for real-time testing.

🧠 How It Works
The input news text is tokenized using BERT tokenizer.

The model processes the input and generates logits.

Softmax converts logits to probabilities.

The class with the highest probability is selected as the prediction.

Optionally, a visual output shows class confidence levels.

📊 Dataset Used
AG News Dataset (commonly used for news topic classification).

Contains news headlines and short descriptions labeled into 4 categories.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch

Hugging Face Transformers

Gradio (optional)

Pandas, NumPy

💡 Use Cases
News aggregation and filtering systems

Content-based recommendation engines

Media monitoring tools

Automated journalism applications

🚀 Conclusion
This classifier shows how transformer models like BERT can be applied to real-world text classification problems such as news categorization. It provides fast, reliable predictions and can be easily extended to other text classification domains.
