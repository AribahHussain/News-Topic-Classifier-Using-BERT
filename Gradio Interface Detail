üñ•Ô∏è Use of Gradio Interface
The project integrates Gradio, a lightweight Python library, to build an intuitive web-based interface for real-time interaction with the BERT model. This allows users to input news text (headlines or short articles) directly through a simple text box and instantly view the model‚Äôs predicted category.

Key advantages of using Gradio:

Real-Time Testing: Users can test the classifier instantly without needing to write code.

User-Friendly Interface: Makes the model accessible to non-technical users through a clean and minimal UI.

Top Prediction Display: Outputs the predicted category along with class confidence scores.

Integration Ready: The interface can be embedded in websites or shared via public links for quick demos.

By using Gradio, the project becomes more interactive, demonstrable, and deployment-ready, ideal for showcasing the model in both academic and real-world settings.
